# Calculate the geographic centre
This project contains a script for calculating the geographic center of an array of points.

### Scenario
You have the coordinates of places that a umber of agents has visited (e.g facebook checkins). Now you want to calculate the geographic center of their activity and the activity radius for each agent to target them more precisely.
